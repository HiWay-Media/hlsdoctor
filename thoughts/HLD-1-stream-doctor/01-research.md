# 01 · Research — HLD-1 A probe that says whether an HLS or RTMP stream is playable


This is the most expensive phase and the one with the highest compression ratio
(~30-50×). It is also the one that most needs subagents.

## Reference questions

From `00-questions.md` — the answers that steer this research:

- <Q1 → answer>
- <Q2 → answer>

## Map of the territory

### Components involved

| Area | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| <name> | `src/...` | <one line> |

### Entry points

| Symbol | Path:line | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `<func>` | `src/...:120` | <one line> |

---

## Existing patterns and conventions

### <Pattern 1>

- **Where:** `src/...:45-80`
- **How it works:** <2-3 lines>
- **Who already uses it:** `src/a.py:12`, `src/b.py:200`

## Constraints

| Constraint | Source | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| <e.g. the `status` column is a DB enum> | `migrations/0042_*.sql:8` | <one line> |

---

## Reuse candidates

What already exists and should not be rewritten:

| What | Path | Note |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

---

## Existing tests

| What it covers | Path | How to run it |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Blind spots

Things you could not determine, and why:

## Facts that contradict the assumptions

If research disproved an assumption from `00-questions.md`, write it here in large
letters. It is the most valuable output of the phase.
